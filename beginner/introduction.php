	        Vi is a text-editor originally created to be used with the Unix operating system. Vi was developed by Bill joy in 1976. It was originally created to be the full screen visual mode of a different editor, ex.<br/>

	        Joy created the first BSD, Berkley Software Distribution, Unix in 1978. He included ex in the distribution, thus exposing his audience to vi for the first time. When he found that most users were only using vi, he made it a hard link to ex in the next release. In 1979 Bill Joy stepped down as the lead developer and Mark Holton took the role. <br/>
